	abstract         = "Research and development labs in academia and industry use bare-metal servers to do benchmarking of software
						systems. In the last decade, cloud computing has grown drastically and it has replaced private data centers
						for many organizations. But bare-metal as a service type of clouds have not become popular due to the
						lower effectiveness of power utilization in these servers and manual intensive work in re-purposing machines.
						In this paper we propose a solution architecture that addresses these issues. The solution architecture is
						implemented in a small-scale data-center in an educational institute. Our solution uses only open source and
						open infrastructure and thus,  avoids vendor lock-in. Our work removes the requirement of manual work using
						MAAS open source software. The monitoring and alerting services of our solution help the data-center
						administrators and computing-system owners in improving the power utilization efficiency, which also leads
						to monetary savings. The code developed is available as open-source at https://github.com/iithcandle/dhi-ojas"}
